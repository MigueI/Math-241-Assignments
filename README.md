# Math-241-Assignments

These are assignments for my Case Studies: Statistical Analysis class. In each homework folder, 
you'll find an R Markdown file, an HTML file generated by the .Rmd file, and the data set(s) I was
working with. 

HW1: Visualization of Houston Airport Data

HW2: Regression Models for OKCupid Profiles and Air Pollution Data

HW3: Time Series - The Poolhall Jukebox, Bitcoin, and Diesel vs. Gasoline Cars.
